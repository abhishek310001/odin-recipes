    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This quick lunch or dinner pizza is made with prepared puff pastry dough as a shortcut. The results are a light, flaky crust for a unique pizza. Feel free to modify with your favorite pizza toppings.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 sheets frozen puff pastry, thawe</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
        <li>1 (14-1/2 ounce can) whole peeled tomatoes, drained</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic</li>
        <li>1 pinch sea salt</li>
        <li>6 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, chopped</li>
        <li>1/4 cup shredded Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
        <li>10 leaf basil leaves, torn</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Spread each sheet of puff pastry onto a piece of lightly floured parchment paper. Use a rolling pin to roll pastry into even rectangles. Lift pastry (with parchment paper) onto baking sheets.

        </li>
        <li>Pierce puff pastry all over with a fork. Beat egg with water in a small dish; brush pastry all over with egg wash.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, pulse tomatoes, 1/2 teaspoon of the olive oil, garlic, and a pinch of salt together in a food processor until pureed.</li>
        <li>Carefully press pastry crusts down to deflate them. Spread half the tomato sauce evenly to within about an inch of edges of each crust; drizzle with remaining olive oil. Top evenly with mozzarella cheese and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake until cheese is melted and crust edges are golden, about 5 minutes more. Remove from the oven and scatter basil leaves over the top. Slice and serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
